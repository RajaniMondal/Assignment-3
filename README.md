Assignment 3: Functions & Modules in Python
Module 4 Overview:
This assignment focuses on writing Python programs that utilize user-defined functions and built-in modules (specifically the `math` module) to perform specific tasks. It helps reinforce concepts such as recursion, modular programming, and mathematical computations using Python's standard library.

Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument.
2. Calculates the factorial of the number using a loop or recursion.
3. Returns the calculated factorial.
4. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the result.

Sample Output:
Enter the number: 5
Factorial of number 5 is: 120

Concepts Used:
- User-defined function
- Recursion
- Conditional statements
- Input/output in Python
Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Asks the user to input a number.
2. uses the `math` module to calculate the following:
   - Square root of the number
   - Natural logarithm (log base e)
   - Sine of the number (in radians)
3. Displays the calculated results clearly.

 Sample Output:
Enter a number: 25
Square root: 5.0
Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine: -0.13235175009777303
Concepts Used:
- Python `math` module
- Built-in mathematical functions
- Floating point input
- Formatted output

How to Run the Programs:

1. Open any Python IDE or editor (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook).
2. Write each taskâ€™s code into a `.py` file or run it in the interpreter.
3. Enter the required input when prompted.
4. View the results in the terminal or output console.
